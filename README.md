👋 Hi, I'm Yashwanth

🎓 Electrical Engineering Student (VJTI)
🤖 Aspiring AI / ML Engineer
📊 Building strong foundations in Python, data systems & problem solving
🚀 Focused on becoming industry-ready before graduation (2027)

🚀 About Me

I’m currently focused on mastering core programming fundamentals before scaling into advanced AI/ML systems.

My approach:

Deep understanding > surface-level learning

Logic building before frameworks

Structured daily execution

Portfolio-driven growth

I’m building clean, modular systems and strengthening algorithmic thinking to prepare for internships and competitive placements.
